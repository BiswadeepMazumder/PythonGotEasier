        <h2>1.1 What is Python?</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It is used for
            a variety of applications such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial
            intelligence.</p>
            <br>
            
                <h3>
                   1.1.a How does python programming language work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Python works by interpreting the code written in the language and
                    executing it on the computer. It is an object-oriented language, which
                    means that it is based on the concept of objects, which can have
                    properties and methods that can be used to perform tasks.
                </p>
                <h3>
                   1.1.b Python vs other programming languages
                </h3>
                <p>

        <h2>1.3 Basic Syntax</h2>
        <p>
            In Python, syntax refers to the set of rules that define how the language is structured and how programs are written.
                <br>
                Some of the key syntaxes in Python:
                <b>Variables, Datatypes, Print Statements, Comments, Indentation</b>
        </p>
        <h3>1.3.1 Variables</h3>
        <p>Variables are used to store data in Python. They are created using the assignment operator (=) and can hold
            different data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.</p>
        <pre>
		<code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
			# Example code for variables
			x = 5
			y = "Hello World"
			z = True
		</code>
	</pre>

        <h3>1.3.2 Data Types</h3>
        <p>
            Python has several built-in data types including numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each data
            type has its own set of operations and methods.<br>
            In Python, data types are used to classify and represent different
            types of data that can be stored in variables. Here are some of the main data types in Python:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Integer: </b>Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point. They can be positive, negative, or zero.</li>
                <li><b>Float: </b>Floats are numbers with a decimal point. They can be positive, negative, or zero.</li>
                <li><b>String: </b>Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes. They can be used to represent text or other types of data.</li>
                <li><b>Boolean: </b>Booleans are true/false values that can be used to represent the result of a logical operation.</li>
                <li><b>List: </b>Lists are ordered sequences of elements, enclosed in square brackets. They can contain elements of any data type, and can be modified using built-in list methods.</li>
                <li><b>Tuple: </b>Tuples are ordered sequences of elements, enclosed in parentheses. They can contain elements of any data type, but cannot be modified once they are created.</li>
                <li><b>Dictionary: </b>Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces. They can be used to store and retrieve data based on a unique key.</li>
            </ol>
                
            <br>
            Python also supports other data types, such as sets, bytes, and
            byte arrays. Understanding the different data types in Python is important for
            working with variables and performing operations on them, such as arithmetic
            operations, string manipulation, and data analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3.3 Print Statements</h3>
        <p>The print() function is used to display output in Python. You can pass different data types as arguments to
            the
            function.</p>
        <pre>
		<code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
			# Example code for print statements
			x = 5
			print(x) # Output: 5
			
			y = "Hello World"
			print(y) # Output: Hello World
		</code>
	</pre>
        <h3>1.3.4 Comments</h3>
        <p>Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. 
            <br>
            In Python
            <ol>
                <li>use the hash symbol (#) to createa single-line comment</li>
                 <li>use the triple quotes (''' ''') to create a multi-line comment.</li>
        </p>
        <pre>
		<code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
			# Example code for comments
			# This is a single-line comment
			
			'''
			This is a
			multi-line
			comment
			'''
		</code>

        <h4>1.5.2.2 While Loops</h4>
        <p>
            The syntax for a while loop is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	while condition:
		# code to be executed while condition is True
                    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	i = 0
	while i < 5:
		print(i)
		i += 1
            </code>

        <h2>1.6 Functions</h2>
        <h3>1.6.1 Defining Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Functions are a way to encapsulate a block of code so that it can be reused. The syntax for defining
            a function is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	def function_name(parameters):
		# code to be executed
		return value
        </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	def add_numbers(x, y):
		return x + y

	result = add_numbers(3, 5)
	print(result)
            </code>
</pre>

        <h3>1.6.2 Calling Functions</h3>

        <p>
            Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times with different arguments. The syntax for
            calling a function is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	result = function_name(arguments)
</code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	result1 = add_numbers(3, 5)
	result2 = add_numbers(7, 9)
	print(result1)
	print(result2)
    </code>
</pre>

        <h3>1.6.3 Parameters and Return Values</h3>
        <p>
            Functions can take one or more parameters, which are input values to the function. Functions can
            also return values, which are output values from the function. Here's an example of a function that
            takes two parameters and returns a value:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	def multiply_numbers(x, y):
		return x * y

	result = multiply_numbers(3, 5)
	print(result)
    </code>
</pre>
