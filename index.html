    <p>
    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    </p>
    <div style="padding: 20px; margin: 0px;">
        <h2>1.1 What is Python?</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It is used for
            a
            variety of applications such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial
            intelligence.</p>

        <h2>1.2 Installing Python</h2>
        <p>To install Python, you can download the installer from the official Python website <a
                href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a> and follow the
            instructions
            for your operating system.</p>

        <h2>1.3 Basic Syntax</h2>
        <h3>1.3.1 Variables</h3>
        <p>Variables are used to store data in Python. They are created using the assignment operator (=) and can hold
            different data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.</p>
        <pre>
		<code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
			# Example code for variables
			x = 5
			y = "Hello World"
			z = True
		</code>
	</pre>

        <h3>1.3.2 Data Types</h3>
        <p>Python has several built-in data types including numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each data
            type has its own set of operations and methods.</p>

        <h3>1.3.3 Print Statements</h3>
        <p>The print() function is used to display output in Python. You can pass different data types as arguments to
            the
            function.</p>
        <pre>
		<code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
			# Example code for print statements
			x = 5
			print(x) # Output: 5
			
			y = "Hello World"
			print(y) # Output: Hello World
		</code>
	</pre>

        <h3>1.3.4 Comments</h3>
        <p>Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. In Python, you can use the hash symbol (#) to
            create
            a single-line comment and triple quotes (''' ''') to create a multi-line comment.</p>
        <pre>
		<code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
			# Example code for comments
			# This is a single-line comment
			
			'''
			This is a
			multi-line
			comment
			'''
		</code>
	</pre>

        <h2>1.4 Operators</h2>
        <h3>1.4.1 Arithmetic Operators</h3>
        <p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations in Python. These include addition (+),
            subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**).</p>

        <h3>1.4.2 Comparison Operators</h3>
        <p>Comparison operators are used to compare values in Python. These include equal to (==), not equal to (!=),
            greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).< /p>

                    <h3>1.4.3 Logical Operators</h3>
                    <p>Logical operators are used to combine and manipulate boolean values in Python. These include and,
                        or,
                        and not.</p>

        <h2>1.5 Control Structures</h2>
        <h3>1.5.1 If/else Statements</h3>
        <p>
            If/else statements are used to make decisions in Python. The syntax for an if/else statement is as
            follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
                if condition:
                    # code to be executed if condition is True
                else:
                    # code to be executed if condition is False
            </code>

        </pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
                    <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
                    	x = 5
                    	if x > 10:
                    		print("x is greater than 10")
                    	else:
                    		print("x is less than or equal to 10")
                        </code>
</pre>

        <h3>1.5.2 For/While Loops</h3>
        <p>
            Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. The two types of loops in Python are the for
            loop and the while loop.
        </p>
        <h4>1.5.2.1 For Loops</h4>
        <p>
            The syntax for a for loop is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
            	for variable in sequence:
		            # code to be executed for each iteration
            </code>

</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	for i in range(5):
		print(i)
    </code>
</pre>

        <h4>1.5.2.2 While Loops</h4>
        <p>
            The syntax for a while loop is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	while condition:
		# code to be executed while condition is True
                    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	i = 0
	while i < 5:
		print(i)
		i += 1
            </code>
</pre>

        <h2>1.6 Functions</h2>
        <h3>1.6.1 Defining Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Functions are a way to encapsulate a block of code so that it can be reused. The syntax for defining
            a function is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	def function_name(parameters):
		# code to be executed
		return value
        </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	def add_numbers(x, y):
		return x + y

	result = add_numbers(3, 5)
	print(result)
            </code>
</pre>

        <h3>1.6.2 Calling Functions</h3>

        <p>
            Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times with different arguments. The syntax for
            calling a function is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	result = function_name(arguments)
</code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	result1 = add_numbers(3, 5)
	result2 = add_numbers(7, 9)
	print(result1)
	print(result2)
    </code>
</pre>

        <h3>1.6.3 Parameters and Return Values</h3>
        <p>
            Functions can take one or more parameters, which are input values to the function. Functions can
            also return values, which are output values from the function. Here's an example of a function that
            takes two parameters and returns a value:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; font-size: 16px; color: #df1215; ">
	def multiply_numbers(x, y):
		return x * y

	result = multiply_numbers(3, 5)
	print(result)
    </code>
